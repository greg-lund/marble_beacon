# Marble Urban Beacon Deployment System

This repository acts as an assembly guide for the COM Deployment System, and all the info that you need to build them can be found here.
For completion of this project, 20 beacons will be manufactured as well as 6-8 modified deployment systems. 
Instructions and files for the beacon are located in the beacon directory. The same is true for the deployment system.
