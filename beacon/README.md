In addition to all of these purchased components, there are a variety of 3D printed and lasercut acrylic parts that need to be made before beginning the full assembly. The appropriate files for the 3D printer and lasercutter can be found in the STL and DXF directories, respectively. 

## 3D Printed Parts
Part's File Name | Quantity | Notes
-------- | -------- | --------
beacon\_foot.STL | 8 | PLA should be fine
electronics\_core\_rail.STL | 12 | PLA should be fine
lid\_bracket.STL | 1 | Use high infill or Onyx<br>as these require holes to be tapped

The lasercut parts for a single beacon have been organized into larger files to be cut out of 1/8"x12"x24" acrylic sheets. There are two main files that take up most of their sheets, and the electronics core must be cut separately.
